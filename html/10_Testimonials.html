                Hi, I am Arpita Suza Jacob It was a great time studying with
                Kanak mam. Although I have already learnt this topic, I have
                learnt new concepts from this one week session. The class was
                also very interactive. Thank you for this opportunity.

                Hello! This is Pragya. I had joined the frontend web development
                workshop held for 7 days. The sessions by our mentor Kanak
                Sengar were really amazing! She did a great job with solving our
                doubts. She allowed us to be frank with her unlike most other
                conventional teachers. I have learned HTML in class 10th and
                after listening to her lecture, I was able to recall everything
                better and expand my knowledge base. All the best to the GS
                community and Mentor Kanak Sengar .

                Very well organized and conceived. By following the course, I'm
                able to learn & build on the concepts. The course exceeded my
                expectations in many regards - especially the access to our
                instructor (Kanak di). She was excellent and her knowledge of
                not just the course material, but related subjects as well!! I
                really enjoyed this session, and looking forward to taking more
                such sessions.
