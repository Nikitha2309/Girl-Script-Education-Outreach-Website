# [GirlScript Education Outreach Website](https://eop.girlscript.tech/)

- Official Website of GirlScript Education Outreach Program developed from scratch during my tenure as a **Web Developer at GirlScript Foundation**. 
- This showcases all the updated information related to ongoing courses, mentors, Team, etc. 
- Users can also register for the courses, sponsor the program, and partner with EOP.
- This platform helped 5000+ students to be updated about the ongoing and upcoming technical and non-technicalcourses and helped the management to onboard the sponsors and partners.
